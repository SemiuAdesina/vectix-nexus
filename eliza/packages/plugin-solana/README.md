# Vectix Solana Plugin

This plugin enables the agent to autonomously sign and send transactions on Solana. It manages private keys securely and exposes actions for:

- **Transfer** — Send SOL or SPL tokens
- **Swap** — Swap tokens via supported DEXes
- **Balance Check** — Query SOL and SPL token balances

Part of the Vectix Foundry Colosseum submission. Requires the agent to be run from the `eliza/` directory of the vectix-nexus repo.
